AS Level

Mark Scheme for June 2024

--- PAGE 2 ---

OCR (Oxford Cambridge and RSA) is a leading UK awarding body, providing a wide range of qualifications to meet the needs of candidates of all ages and abilities.  OCR qualifications include AS/A Levels, Diplomas, GCSEs, Cambridge Nationals, Cambridge Technicals, Functional Skills, Key Skills, Entry Level qualifications, NVQs and vocational qualifications in areas such as IT, business, languages, teaching/training, administration and secretarial skills.

It is also responsible for developing new specifications to meet national requirements and the needs of students and teachers.  OCR is a not-for-profit organisation; any surplus made is invested back into the establishment to help towards the development of qualifications and support, which keep pace with the changing needs of today's society.

This mark scheme is published as an aid to teachers and students, to indicate the requirements of the examination. It shows the basis on which marks were awarded by examiners. It does not indicate the details of the discussions which took place at an examiners' meeting before marking commenced.

All examiners are instructed that alternative correct answers and unexpected approaches in candidates' scripts must be given marks that fairly reflect the relevant knowledge and skills demonstrated.

Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the published question papers and the report on the examination.

## MARKING INSTRUCTIONS PREPARATION FOR MARKING

## H046/02 SCORIS

1. Make sure that you have accessed and completed the relevant training packages for on-screen marking: RM assessor Online Training ; OCR Essential Guide to Marking .
2. Make sure that you have read and understood the mark scheme and the question paper for this unit. These are posted on the RM Cambridge Assessment Support Portal http://www.rm.com/support/ca
3. Log-in to RM assessor and mark the required number of practice responses ('scripts') and the number of required standardisation responses.

YOU MUST MARK 10 PRACTICE AND 10 STANDARDISATION RESPONSES BEFORE YOU CAN BE APPROVED TO MARK LIVE SCRIPTS.

## MARKING

1. Mark strictly to the mark scheme.
2. Marks awarded must relate directly to the marking criteria.
3. The schedule of dates is very important. It is essential that you meet the 50% and 100% deadlines. If you experience problems, you must contact your Team Leader (Supervisor) without delay.
4. If you are in any doubt about applying the mark scheme, consult your Team Leader by telephone or the RM assessor messaging system, or by email.

## 5. Crossed Out Responses

Where a candidate has crossed out a response and provided a clear alternative then the crossed out response is not marked. Where no alternative response has been provided, examiners may give candidates the benefit of the doubt and mark the crossed out response where legible.

## Rubric Error Responses - Optional Questions

Where candidates have a choice of question across a whole paper or a whole section and have provided more answers than required, then all responses are marked and the highest mark allowable within the rubric is given. Enter a mark for each question answered into RM assessor, which will select the highest  mark  from  those  awarded. (The underlying assumption is that the candidate has penalised themselves by attempting more questions than necessary in the time allowed.)

## Multiple Choice Question Responses

When a multiple choice question has only a single, correct response and a candidate provides two responses (even if one of these responses is correct), then no mark should be awarded (as it is not possible to determine which was the first response selected by the candidate).

--- PAGE 4 ---

## H046/02

When a question requires candidates to select more than one option/multiple options, then local marking arrangements need to ensure consistency of approach.

## Contradictory Responses

When a candidate provides contradictory responses, then no mark should be awarded, even if one of the answers is correct.

## Short Answer Questions (requiring only a list by way of a response, usually worth only one mark per response )

Where candidates are required to provide a set number of short answer responses then only the set number of responses should  be marked. The response space should be marked from left to right on each line and then line by line until the required number of responses have been considered.  The remaining responses should not then be marked. Examiners will have to apply judgement as to whether a 'second response' on a line is a development of the 'first response', rather than a separate, discrete response. (The underlying assumption is that the candidate is attempting to hedge their bets and therefore getting undue benefit rather than engaging with the question and giving the most relevant/correct responses.)

## Short Answer Questions (requiring a more developed response, worth two or more marks )

If the candidates are required to provide a description of, say, three items or factors and four items or factors are provided, then mark on a similar basis - that is downwards (as it is unlikely in this situation that a candidate will provide more than one response in each section of the response space.)

## Longer Answer Questions (requiring a developed response)

Where candidates have provided two (or more) responses to a medium or high tariff question which only required a single (developed) response and not crossed out the first response, then only the first response should be marked. Examiners will need to apply professional judgement as to whether the second (or a subsequent) response is a 'new start' or simply a poorly expressed continuation of the first response.

6. Always check the pages (and additional objects if present) at the end of the response in case any answers have been continued there. If the candidate has continued an answer there then add a tick to confirm that the work has been seen.
7.      Award No Response (NR) if:
- there is nothing written in the answer space

## Award Zero '0' if:

- anything is written in the answer space and is not worthy of credit (this includes text and symbols).

Team Leaders must confirm the correct use of the NR button with their markers before live marking commences and should check this when reviewing scripts.

8. The RM assessor comments box is used by your team leader to explain the marking of the practice responses. Please refer to these comments when checking your practice responses. Do not use the comments box for any other reason. If you have any questions or comments for your team leader, use the phone, the RM assessor messaging system, or e-mail.

## Mark Scheme

9. Assistant Examiners will send a brief report on the performance of candidates to their Team Leader (Supervisor) via email by the end of the marking period. The report should contain notes on particular strengths displayed as well as common errors or weaknesses. Constructive criticism of the question paper/mark scheme is also appreciated.
10. For answers marked by levels of response: Not applicable in F501
- a. To determine the level - start at the highest level and work down until you reach the level that matches the answer
- b. To determine the mark within the level , consider the following:

| Descriptor                                            | Award mark                                                                                                |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| On the borderline of this level and the one below     | At bottom of level                                                                                        |
| Just enough achievement on balance for this level     | Above bottom and either below middle or at middle of level (depending on number of marks available)       |
| Meets the criteria but with some slight inconsistency | Above middle and either below top of level or at middle of level (depending on number of marks available) |
| Consistently meets the criteria for this level        | At top of level                                                                                           |

|          3 | (a)        | Answer Mark Band 3-High Level (7-9 marks) The candidate demonstrates thorough knowledge and understanding of suitability of algorithms; the material is generally accurate and detailed. The candidate is able to apply their knowledge and understanding directly and consistently to the context provided. Evidence/examples will be explicitly relevant to the explanation. The candidate provides a thorough discussion which is well- balanced. Evaluative comments are consistently relevant and well-considered. There is a well-developed line of reasoning which is clear and logically structured. The information presented is relevant and substantiated. Mark Band 2-Mid Level (4-6 marks) The candidate demonstrates reasonable knowledge and understanding of suitability of algorithms; the material is generally accurate but at times underdeveloped. The candidate is able to apply their knowledge and understanding directly to the context provided although one or two opportunities are missed. Evidence/examples are for the most part implicitly relevant to the explanation. The candidate provides a reasonable discussion, the majority of which is focused. Evaluative comments are for the most part appropriate, although one or two opportunities for development are missed. 9 | AO1: Knowledge and Understanding e.g. • Kofi's algorithm reads data from the text file and writes these value to an array. It cannot be called by different programs, doesn't work with different text files and does not consider the number of items in the file. • Zac's program also reads data from the text file and writes these values to an array. It can be called by different programs, works with different file names and does consider the number of items in the file. AO2.1: Application e.g. Kofi's algorithm: • Has additional/unnecessary variables • …e.g. fileName, dataValue • Loops 1000 times which is inappropriate when it needs to be used with unknown quantity • Will not read any lines after the first 1000 Zac's algorithm: • Uses a function so that is can be used in different programs // is independent • Takes file name as parameter so that it can be called with different files • The array size is 100. Therefore, if the data being read is greater than 100 the program will crash. • Does not close the file AO3.3: Evaluation e.g. • Zac's is more memory efficient as it uses fewer variables • Kofi's is more suitable in that it closes the file so it does not remain open in memory • Zac's is more suitable to be used in different programs due to function and not hard coding the file name |
